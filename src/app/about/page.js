          Born in the heart of Oklahoma and raised amidst the scenic landscapes of Arkansas, this
          talented artist has cultivated a unique perspective over his 20-year journey in painting.
          Specializing in impressionistic works, he finds inspiration in the beauty of everyday life,
          capturing landscapes, figures, cityscapes, and animals with a keen eye for detail and
          emotion. His palette is rich with vibrant hues, primarily using oil paint, while also

          Beyond his studio, he enjoys hanging out wherever there is live music, finding that the
          rhythm and energy of performances fuel his creativity. Long drives through the countryside
          are a cherished pastime, where he takes to random roads in search of new subjects to paint.
          Whether it&apos;s a tranquil farm scene or the lively spirit of city life, he is drawn
          especially to ordinary moments that resonate with authenticity.
